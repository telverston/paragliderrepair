                    <p>
                        Turn around time should be within about one week. We can
                        get busy, usually when conditions are best for flying.
                        However, we do not charge extra for rush repairs. But we
                        do ask that you only request rush if you really need it.

                    <p>
                        Our high skill level and low overhead keep our prices
                        very reasonable. We charge only by the hour and the
                        average cost for paragliders is between $35 and $340. We
                        like hearing that our prices are awesome, so we keep
                        them that way.

                        Above is a Mac Para Eden 3 28 meter wing we repaired for
                        Brian Haupt. Thanks Brian! You can see our repair on the
                        port side of the wing. This complex damage was caused by
                        a bridle line getting caught in the motor. Inside was
                        major damage to the ribs and dribs and tow points, and
                        the outside needed coverage because it had become fuzzy.
                        It's dimensionally perfect. You can read about the

                    <p>
                        We repair and replace any and all paraglider bridles and
                        lines. We match loop dimensions, stitch patterns,
                        materials, and overall lengths within 1-2mm. We will
                        also make lines to your spec upon request. Many
                        customers prefer to send in the entire wing, and let us
                        handle the job of fabricating and installing the new
                        paraglider lines. However, if only one or two lines are
                        damaged, and you want to install them yourself, just
                        photograph your loops next to a metric ruler and send us
                        that along with the other specs for the lines you'd like
                        us to make.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We use OEM line specific to paragliding manufactured in
                        Germany. Tedlar, Spectra, Dyneema, and Kevlar cores with
                        and without Dacron jacket. Normally we can match color
                        closely, if not perfectly. Often our line is slightly
                        better than the original material. Many customers have
                        damage on one side but not the other since often the
                        prop will snag only a few lines. Sometimes it's
                        reccomended to replace lines in pairs (both the bad
                        lines and their mirror opposites), but normally it's not
                        necessary. We have a lot of different lines available
                        for the repair of paraglider tension systems, many more
                        than in the below images.

                            Thanks again for your great service, I really
                            appreciate it!

                            Just to let you know that my friend was really
                            impressed with your repair work. He said that the

                            nice letter from the customer about it. He was
                            riding his friend's rig and ended up damaging it. I

                            Below is another wing that was blown open from
                            leading to trailing edge. We are looking at the
                            topside here. This happened during a hard crash on
                            the leading edge causing a shockwave to form which
                            exploited the seam nearest the impact. The ribs were
                            also damaged at the reinforcement points. The second
                            image shows the wing put back together with absolute
                            dimensional accuracy, it's even slightly stronger
                            than it was before.

                        We found this to be a particularly involved repair since
                        the large amount of damage ran just along the seams. We
                        try whenever possible to put the wing back together with
                        minimal deconstruction. We were quite proud of the way
                        these repairs slipped under the existing seams with just
                        a small amount of stitch removal and replacement. Some
                        work still remains to do at the time these shots were
                        taken. Two or three lines need to be replaced. We
                        fabricate lines with absolute accuracy.

                    <h3>Why are we using tripple step zigzag?</h3>
                    <p>
                        It's true, it's not found anywhere else on most
                        paragliders. So why then would we choose to do this?
                        Well, in fact, damage is always a unique situation in
                        the structure. Aside from an area that's damaged, no
                        where else are there two edges that need to be joined
                        together the way ripped edges do. With damage, all of a
                        sudden there are edges that need to meet up perfectly,
                        fiber-for-fiber, edge to edge. A normal seam will not do
                        because a normal seam subtracts any dimension beyond the
                        stitch. When making a wing from the start, it's easy to
                        just build in all of these seam allowances and simply
                        follow the dimension that's been set in the design.
                        Repairs are a different story, they have no seam
                        allowances. Repairs must be done flat, and without any
                        extra cloth being subracted from the wing. Instead we
                        add cloth (usually internally) to bridge the rips. The
                        perimeter of this new cloth gets sewn down and tied into
                        the structure of the wing. The strongest stitch to do
                        flat joining like this is the tripple-step, or running
                        zigzag. We also sew radially around curved corners and
                        avoid over-tacking the terminations of patches by
                        slipping into the same needle holes.
