          Above is a Mac Para Eden 3 28 meter  wing we repaired for Brian Haupt. Thanks Brian! You can see our repair on the port side of the wing. This complex damage was caused by a bridle line getting caught in the motor. Inside was major damage to the ribs and dribs and tow points, and the outside needed coverage because it had become fuzzy. It's dimensionally perfect. You can read about the process in this <a href="http://kiterepairs.blogspot.com/2009/04/paraglider-repair-keep-track-of-dribs.html">blog post</a>.</p>

          We repair and replace any and all paraglider  bridles and lines. We match loop dimensions, stitch patterns, materials, and overall lengths within 1-2mm.  We will also make lines to your spec upon request. Many customers prefer to send in the entire wing, and let us handle the job of fabricating and installing the new paraglider lines. However, if only one or two lines are damaged, and you want to install them yourself, just photograph your loops next to a metric ruler and send us that along with the other specs for the lines you'd like us to make.</p>
        <p>We use OEM line specific to paragliding manufactured in Germany. Tedlar, Spectra, Dyneema, and Kevlar cores with and without Dacron jacket. Normally we can match color closely, if not perfectly. Often our line is slightly better than the original material. Many customers have damage on one side but not the other since often the prop will snag only a few lines. Sometimes it's reccomended to replace lines in pairs (both the bad lines and their mirror opposites), but normally it's not necessary. We have a lot of different lines available for the repair of paraglider tension systems, many more than in the below images. </p>

          <p>Above is the closeup of the finished work. We got a nice letter from the customer about it. He was riding his friend's rig and ended up damaging it. I often wonder if people damage their friends gear with a greater frequency than their own simply because of bad luck.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Below is another wing that was blown open from leading to trailing edge. We are looking at the topside here. This happened during a hard crash on the leading edge causing a shockwave to form which exploited the seam nearest the impact. The ribs were also damaged at the reinforcement points. The second image shows the wing put back together with absolute dimensional accuracy, it's even slightly stronger than it was before.</p>

        <p>We found this to be a particularly involved repair since the large amount of damage ran just along the seams. We try whenever possible to put the wing back together with minimal deconstruction. We were quite proud of the way these repairs slipped under the existing seams with just a small amount of stitch removal and replacement. Some work still remains to do at the time these shots were taken. Two or three lines need to be replaced. We fabricate lines with absolute accuracy.</p>

        <p>Why are we using tripple step zigzag?</p>
        <p>It's true, it's not found anywhere else on most paragliders. So why then would we choose to do this? Well, in fact, damage is always a unique situation in the structure. Aside from an area that's damaged, no where else are there two edges that need to be joined together the way ripped edges do. With damage, all of a sudden there are edges that need to meet up perfectly, fiber-for-fiber, edge to edge. A normal seam will not do because a normal seam subtracts any dimension beyond the stitch. When making a wing from the start, it's easy to just build in all of these seam allowances and simply follow the dimension that's been set in the design. Repairs are a different story, they have no seam allowances. Repairs must be done flat, and without any extra cloth being subracted from the wing. Instead we add cloth (usually internally) to bridge the rips. The perimeter of this new cloth gets sewn down and tied into the structure of the wing. The strongest stitch to do flat joining like this is the tripple-step, or running zigzag. We also sew radially around curved corners and avoid over-tacking the terminations of patches by slipping into the same needle holes.</p>
